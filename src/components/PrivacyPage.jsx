          <Trans>
            Point Taken is a free, real-time planning-poker room for teams. It is built privacy-first:
            no accounts, no tracking, and no more data than a voting session actually needs. This page
            explains, in plain language, what is stored, what is not, and how to remove it.

              There is nothing to register. When you create or join a room you type a display name, to
              which the app appends a short random suffix so people with the same name stay distinct.
              You are identified only within that one room, only for as long as it exists.

          <h2><Trans>What is stored while a room is live</Trans></h2>
          <p><Trans>Each room keeps only what it needs to run the session on the server that hosts it:</Trans></p>
          <ul>
            <li><Trans>The room name, the planning deck, and the room settings.</Trans></li>
            <li><Trans>Participant display names and their role (facilitator, voter, or observer).</Trans></li>
            <li><Trans>Votes during a round and the finalized estimates in the room’s history.</Trans></li>
            <li><Trans>Short-lived reactions and raised hands, which clear on their own within seconds.</Trans></li>
            <li>
              <Trans>
                A one-way hash (SHA-256) of the facilitator recovery code. The code itself is shown to
                you once and is never stored — we keep only the hash so it can be checked, not recovered.
              </Trans>
            </li>
            <li><Trans>Timestamps for when the room was created, last used, and is due to expire.</Trans></li>

          <p>
            <Trans>
              Votes stay hidden from other participants until the facilitator reveals them (or everyone
              has voted, if auto-reveal is on). We do not store IP addresses alongside your activity.

                <strong>One identity cookie per room</strong> (<code>point_taken_identity</code>): a random
                token that binds your browser to your seat so your votes and role survive a refresh or
                reconnect. It is <code>HttpOnly</code>, <code>SameSite=Strict</code>, scoped to that room’s
                path, and expires within 7 days. It is not an advertising or analytics cookie.

                <strong>Local storage</strong>: your last-used display name and the link to your most recent
                room, so join and create forms can prefill and the home page can offer you the room again.
                It also remembers if you dismissed the “buy me a coffee” banner, so it stays hidden for a week,
                and your language choice if you switch languages in the app.

              The app runs on Cloudflare’s network (Workers and Durable Objects). To deliver the service
              and protect it from abuse, Cloudflare processes connection details — including your IP
              address — transiently for connectivity, security, and rate-limiting. The app uses your IP
              only as a short-lived counter to limit how many rooms can be created or joined in a short
              window; it is not linked to your name or votes. This processing is covered by Cloudflare’s
              own privacy practices.

              fitness for any particular purpose are not guaranteed. Please don’t rely on a room as a

          <p>
            <Trans>
              Point Taken is free and has no ads or paid tiers. A small banner may invite you to support
              its upkeep by “buying me a coffee.” It is entirely optional and changes nothing about the app
              if you ignore or dismiss it — dismissing it just hides it for a week (see browser storage above).
              The link opens an external payment service (Buy Me a Coffee) in a new tab; no third-party
              scripts or trackers are loaded inside Point Taken itself, but once you follow that link you are
              on their site, subject to their own privacy practices.
